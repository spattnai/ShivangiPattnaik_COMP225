Project Title: Shopping List
----------------------------

Project Details
---------------

In this project, I have built an android application for creating a shopping list. The shopping list helps you list the itemname and quantity of the items you want to buy before going to the store. This application comes handy in situations when you have multiple items to buy and can be well used for grocery shopping.

Building the application
------------------------

- Once I had created a new android application project on eclipse, I created several classes in the source directory that would help me build a database for storing values inputed. 
- I first used a local SQLite database to store the Itemname and quantity and it will show them as string in TextView. 
- I also included the activity class for writing out the functions that are necessary for the shopping list application called ShoppingList. I also created the ShoppingProvider and Constants which are also important.
- I created xml files called items and main for the layout of the application. I took into account the various files I had generated and made minute changes in the Android Manifest file. The Android Manifest xml file contains application which the system must know before running the application codes. It is one of the most important files that are responsible for the application to run on the emulator.


Running the application
-----------------------
I ran the application using the emulator with a minimum SDK of Android 2.3.3 GingerBread API 10. I even tested the code on an android media player and it worked fine. 

Notes
-----
- I used the codes from Events to get an idea on how to build my project. 
- I used the book "hello-android_p8" for references and learned how to build the Activity classes, database and create xml files which are some of the important components required for successfully running the application.
